Runner:
import the Scanner class
allow the user to give coordinates via Scanner - in coordinate form
    use string.substring to get x and y values.
        - only way this works is if the user inputs the values accordingly
            - find the length of the string ( without parenthesis )
                - set substirng(1, length - 1)
                    - find comma then you create two variables
            - turn the values from String into integers using "parse out".
    print toString values ( all the LinearEquation values )
        - then ask for a x value ( can be a double )
            - solve by substituting into the equation of the line.

LinearEquation:
Create four parameters with x1, x2, y1, y2
Create variables for the parameters ^
Create constructor ^ assign parameters to variables
Create a method for each, solve using math
    The two original points
        - just return x and y values of both coordinates
    The equation of the line through the two points in y = mx + b format
        - y = slope(x) + b
    The slope of the line
        - y2-y1/x2-x1
            - do this separately to keep the fraction.
    The y-intercept of the line
        - is b in y = mx + b
    The distance between the two points
        - sqrroot((x2-x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
            - make a double before using this equation
    Solve through substituting the x value given from the user into the equation.

toString:
    Turn each of the values from LinearEquation into a String
    "First pair: "
    "Second pair: "
    "Slope of line: "
    "Y-intercept: "
    "Slope intercept form: "
    "Distance between points: "
    "Solved coordinate point is: "
        Later used in the Runner to print out the information for the user
